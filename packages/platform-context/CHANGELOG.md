## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-21 (ADR-167 v1.1)

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Default `HEALTH_PROBE_PATHS` reduced to `{"/livez/", "/healthz/"}`.
  `/readyz/` and `/health/` are no longer bypassed.
- Response format is now `text/plain` ("ok\n") by default (was JSON).
  Use `Accept: application/json` header or `HEALTH_RESPONSE_FORMAT = "json"`.
- Non-GET/HEAD requests to health paths return `405 Method Not Allowed` (was 200).

### Added
- `health/views.py` — `ReadinessView` (opt-in DB-checking readiness endpoint)
- `health/urls.py` — URL patterns for `ReadinessView` at `/readyz/`
- `health_checks.py` — Django system checks (`E167.*`/`W167.*`) for ADR-167 compliance
- `metrics.py` — Prometheus counter `iil_health_probe_total{path,mode}` with `_NoopCounter` fallback
- Content negotiation: Accept header selects JSON or text/plain response
- Response headers: `Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- Async dual-mode: `@sync_and_async_middleware` for ASGI-native dispatch
- Structured DEBUG logging on health path hits

### Changed
- `middleware.py` — `HealthBypassMiddleware` rewritten as function-based dual-mode middleware
- `apps.py` — `PlatformContextConfig.ready()` now registers ADR-167 system checks
